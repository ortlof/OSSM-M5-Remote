# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.1] - Work in Progress

### Added

- Added build flag `-D SERIAL_INFO` to platformio.ini to enable / disable all `Serial.print()` statements. On some boards with native USB those Serial prints have been reported to block and make the server unresponsive.
- Added a hook handler to StatefulService. Unlike an UPDATE a hook is called every time a state receives and updated, even if the result is UNCHANGED or ERROR.
- Added missing include for S2 in SystemStatus.cpp (#23)
- Added awareness of front end build script for all 3 major JS package managers. The script will auto-identify the package manager by the lock-file. (#40)
- Added a new event source to bundle the websocket server and the notifications events. This saves open sockets and allows up to 2 concurrent visitors of the internal website. The normal websocket server endpoint remains as an option, should a pure websocket connection be desired. An EventEndpoint was added to use this in Stateful Services. (#29 and #43)
- TS Types definition in one central place for the frontend.

### Changed

- more generic board definition in platformio.ini (#20)
- refactored MqttEndpoint.h into a single class to improve readability
- Moves appName and copyright to `layout.ts` to keep customization in one place (#31)
- Make eventSource use timeout for reconnect (#34)
- Make each toasts disappear after timeout (#35)
- Fixed version `platform = espressif32 @ 6.6.0` in platformio.ini
- Renamed `MqttPubSub.h` and class to `MqttEndpoint.h` and class.
- Analytics data limited to 1000 data points (roughly 33 minutes).

### Fixed

- Fixed compile error with FLAG `-D SERVE_CONFIG_FILES`
- Fixed typo in telemetry.ts (#38)
- Fixed the development warning: `Loading /rest/features using `window.fetch`. For best results, use the `fetch`that is passed to your`load` function:`

### Removed

- Duplicate method in FeatureService (#18)
- Duplicate lines in Systems Settings view.
- Removes duplicate begin (#36)

## [0.3.0] - 2023-02-05

> [!CAUTION]
> This update has breaking changes!

This is a major change getting rid of all ESPAsyncTCP and ESPAsyncWebserver dependencies. Despite their popularity they are plagued with countless bugs, since years unmaintained, not SSL capable and simply not suitable for a production build. Although several attempts exist to fix the most pressing bugs even these libraries lead to frequent crashes. This new version replaces them with ESP-IDF based components. [PsychicHttp](https://github.com/hoeken/PsychicHttp) and [PsychicMqttClient](https://github.com/theelims/PsychicMqttClient) both wrap the ESP-IDF components in a familiar wrapper for easy porting of the code base. However, this will break existing code and will require some effort on your codebase. In return the stability is improved greatly and the RAM usage more friendly. Now e.g. running Bluetooth in parallel becomes possible.

### Added

- Added postscript to platform.io build process to copy, rename and calculate MD5 checksum of \*.bin file. These files are ready for uploading to the Github Release page.
- Added more information to SystemStatus API
- Added generateToken API for security settings
- Added Multi-WiFi capability. Add up to five WiFi configurations and connect to either strongest network (default), or by priority.
- Added InfoDialog as a simpler version of the ConfirmDialog for a simple notification modal.
- Added Adafruit certificate repository as the default choice for the X509 certificate bundle.

### Changed

- Better route protection for user page with deep link.
- Changed build_interface.py script to check for modified files in the interface sources before re-building the interface. Saves some time on the compilation process.
- Upload firmware binary allows uploading of MD5 checksum file in advance to verify downloaded firmware package.
- GithubFirmwareManager checks against PIO build_target in filename to support Github OTA for binaries build for various targets. You should rename your old release \*.bin files on the Github release pages for backward compatibility.
- Changed MQTT Client to an ESP-IDF backed one which supports SSL/TLS X509 root CA bundles and transport over WS.
- Changed the `PROGMEM_WWW` flag to `EMBED_WWW` as there is technically speaking no PROGMEM on ESP32's.
- Updated dependencies to the latest version. Except SvelteKit.

### Fixed

- Fixed reactivity of System Status page.

### Removed

- Removed support for Arduino ESP OTA.
- HttpEndpoints and Websocket Server without a securityManager are no longer possible.

### Migrate from ESPAsyncWebServer to PsychicHttp

#### Migrate `main.cpp`

Change the server and ESPSvelteKit instances to PsychicHttpServer and give the ESP32SvelteKit constructor the number of http endpoints of your project.

```
PsychicHttpServer server;
ESP32SvelteKit esp32sveltekit(&server, 120);
```

Remove `server.begin();` in `void setup()`. This is handled by ESP32SvelteKit now.

#### Migrate `platformio.ini`

Remove the following `build_flags`:

```ini
    ; Increase queue size of SSE and WS
    -D SSE_MAX_QUEUED_MESSAGES=64
    -D WS_MAX_QUEUED_MESSAGES=64
    -D CONFIG_ASYNC_TCP_RUNNING_CORE=0
    -D NO_GLOBAL_ARDUINOOTA
    -D PROGMEM_WWW
```

Add the following `build_flags` and adjust to your app, if needed:

```ini
    -D BUILD_TARGET=\"$PIOENV\"
    -D APP_NAME=\"ESP32-Sveltekit\" ; Must only contain characters from [a-zA-Z0-9-_] as this is converted into a filename
    -D APP_VERSION=\"0.3.0\" ; semver compatible version string
    -D EMBED_WWW
```

Remove the lib dependency `esphome/AsyncTCP-esphome @ ^2.0.0` and add `https://github.com/theelims/PsychicMqttClient.git`

Consider adjusting `board_ssl_cert_source = adafruit`, so that the new MQTT client has universal SSL/TLS support with a wide range of CA root certificates.

#### Migrate `factory_settings.ini`

The new MQTT client has slightly renamed factory settings:

```ini
  ; MQTT settings
  -D FACTORY_MQTT_ENABLED=false
  -D FACTORY_MQTT_URI=\"mqtts://mqtt.eclipseprojects.io:8883\"
  -D FACTORY_MQTT_USERNAME=\"\" ; supports placeholders
  -D FACTORY_MQTT_PASSWORD=\"\"
  -D FACTORY_MQTT_CLIENT_ID=\"#{platform}-#{unique_id}\" ; supports placeholders
  -D FACTORY_MQTT_KEEP_ALIVE=120
  -D FACTORY_MQTT_CLEAN_SESSION=true
```

Max Topic Length is no longer needed.

#### Custom Stateful Services

Adapt the class constructor (`(PsychicHttpServer *server, ...`) to PsychicHttpServer.

Due to the loading sequence HttpEndoint and WebsocketServer both have gotten a `begin()` function to register their http endpoints with the server. This must be called in your stateful services' own `begin()` function:

```cpp
void LightStateService::begin()
{
    _httpEndpoint.begin();
    _webSocketServer.begin();
    _state.ledOn = DEFAULT_LED_STATE;
    onConfigUpdated();
}
```

- Made code of LightStateExample slightly more verbose
